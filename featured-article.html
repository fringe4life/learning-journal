      <h2>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
      <p>
        As I progress through Scrimba's interactive courses, I'm gradually
        honing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, building a solid foundation
        for my career as a frontend developer. This site uses, Vite, PostCSS,
        grid and subgrid!
      </p>

    <div
      role="img"
      class="featured-background-img featured-background-img--without-gradient content"

    </div>
    <main class="content main" role="main">
      <!-- style is using space toggle to turn off uppercase font -->

        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
          learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in this project I have experimented with the <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuZizqDF4q8"
          >Space Toggle</a> idea in CSS. What the Space Toggle does is enable a
          rudimentary type of <strong>if else</strong> statement in CSS. On this
          page for instance, I set the custom property controlling the uppercase
          of the first p to an empty space which invalidated the uppercase
          text-transform at runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this, I used a PostCSS plugin which enabled me to use the
          @custom-media rule so at medium screen sizes I can simply use the
          custom media query --medium-width.
        </p>
        <p>
          That helped me further my CSS skills through applying new things, and
          I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others
          learn and stay motivated.

          <h3>Container Queries</h3>
          <p>
            I practised on this site using container queries. As an example to
            detect whether there were three auto-fit columns, then I used
            container queries to achieve this.
          </p>

          <h3>Grid autofit</h3>
          <p>
            On this website there is an auto-fit to display the post card so
            when the screen grows in size more columns are added automatically
            to add new posts instead of having to use @media or @container to
            figure out each individual place to put the post card. The
            individual post cards then span 1 column each!
          </p>

          <h3>Flexbox</h3>
          <p>
            For the header I briefly tried to use Grid. However, grid was not
            that great a fit for a 2d layout like that and so I chose to use
            flexbox with justify-content: space-between; to get them to go to
            either end of their space from the main grid which limited them to
            the content part of the grid.
