      <h2>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
      <p>
        As I progress through Scrimba's interactive courses, I'm gradually
        honing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, building a solid foundation
        for my career as a frontend developer. This site uses, Vite, PostCSS,
        grid and subgrid!
      </p>

      <section class="featured-post invert" style="--uppercase: var(--OFF)">
        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
          learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in this project I have experimented with the <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuZizqDF4q8"
          >Space Toggle</a> idea in CSS. What the Space Toggle does is enable a
          rudimentary type of <strong>if else</strong> statement in CSS. On this
          page for instance, I set the custom property controlling the
          background-image to an empty space which invalidated it at run time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this I used another <strong>if else</strong> logic to change the
          color of the text by checking if the background-image was set or not.
          If it was not set then the color would be inverted, as originally the
          color was white to make it visible over the image.
        </p>
        <p>
          That helped me further my CSS skills through applying new things, and
          I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others
          learn and stay motivated.
