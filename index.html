        <h2>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
        <p>
          As I progress through Scrimba's interactive courses, I'm gradually
          honing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, building a solid
          foundation for my career as a frontend developer. This site uses,
          Vite, PostCSS, grid and subgrid!

          <h3>Container Queries</h3>
          <p>
            I practised on this site using container queries. As an example to
            detect whether there were three auto-fit columns, then I used
            calc((310px * 3) + (2 * 1.25em) + (2 * 1em). What this does is take
            the column size, 310px and multiplies it by 3 and then adds in the
            gaps and margins.

          <h3>Descendant Selector</h3>
          <p>
            Another thing that I used to achieve this layout was to use the
            descendent selector for setting grid columns. An immediate child of
            a grid could have the class 'full' or 'content' added to them to
            enable them to take up the full width, e.g. the featured --card or
            limit them to the content area of the grid for everything else.

          <h3>@import</h3>
          <p>
            I broke the CSS for this website up into a series of files to be
            imported into the main.css file. This enables me to find the
            particular component or area of the site quickly. For instance,
            there is a header.css, footer.css, --card.css etc.
          </p>

          <h3>PostCSS</h3>
          <p>
            On this website I used PostCSS to create a Mixin for typography in
            particular as there is so much commonalities for almost all text on
            this page. All the various text has font-weight, font-size,
            line-height and color so a Mixin was made to simply @mixin the
            typography and get the font related CSS to a single line.

          <h3>Grid autofit</h3>
          <p>
            On this website there is an auto-fit to display the post card so
            when the screen grows in size more columns are added automatically
            to add new posts instead of having to use @media or @container to
            figure out each individual place to put the post card. The
            individual post cards then span 1 column each!
          </p>

          <h3>Flexbox</h3>
          <p>
            For the header I briefly tried to use Grid. However, grid was not
            that great a fit for a 2d layout like that and so I chose to use
            flexbox with justify-content: space-between; to get them to go to
            either end of their space from the main grid which limited them to
            the content part of the grid.
